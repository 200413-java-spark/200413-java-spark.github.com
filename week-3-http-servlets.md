# Week 3 - HTTP & Servlet API
## Concepts
- HTTP:
  - Request vs Response
  - Protocol:
    - Verbs: Get, Post, Put, Delete, Head, Options, Trace
    - URI
    - Version
    - Headers: Content-Type, Content-Length
    - Body
- Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) 7
  - Layered Architecture: Presentation, Business, Persistence
- Servlet: 
  - Servlet interface life-cycle methods
  - Servlet Container
  - ServletContext vs ServletConfig
  - Forward vs Redirect
  - Session vs Cookie
  - Deployment Descriptor:
    - `web.xml` tags: servlet-name, servlet-class, url-mapping, load-on-startup, init-param, context-param

## Syntax
- [javax.servlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/package-summary.html):
  - [Servlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/Servlet.html): init(), service(), destroy()
  - [ServletContext](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html)
  - [ServletConfig](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletConfig.html): getInitParameter()
  - [GenericServlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/GenericServlet.html): getServletConfig(), getServletContext() 
  - [ServletRequest](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletRequest.html): getAttribute(), getParameter(), getRequestDispatcher()
  - [RequestDispatcher](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/RequestDispatcher.html): forward()
  - [ServletResponse](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletResponse.html)
  - [javax.servlet.annotations]:
    - [WebServlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/annotation/WebServlet.html)
  - [javax.servlet.http](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/package-summary.html):
    - [HttpServlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html): doGet(), doPost()
    - [HttpServletRequest](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html): getSession() 
    - [HttpServletResponse](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html): setHeader(), setStatus(), sendRedirect()
    - [HttpSession](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html) & [Cookie](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html)
    - [Cookie](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html)
